# Frontend Guide

This is a guide for frontend-specific tasks like client SDK generation, development, and configuration.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1. Install pnpm (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 1.2. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 1.3. Start development server

pnpm run dev
```

## 2. Client SDK Generation

To regenerate the frontend TypeScript API client SDK when the backend routes change (run from the project root):
```bash
bash ./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

## 3. Using a Remote API

If you want to use a remote API, you can set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to the URL of the remote API in your `frontend/.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.my-domain.example.com
```
